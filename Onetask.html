				<p>We have often done a lot of multitasking, but at some point of time the tasks overburden and we end
						up doing nothing! <br>
						I teamed up with a developer to create an App that would help users focus on single task at hand and
						move a lot of tasks to closure!</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/OTCover.png" alt=""  /></span>				
				<h3>INITIAL BRAINSTORMING AND MARKET RESEARCH </h3>
				<p>Even while creating this portfolio - there are various aspects to take care of, different pages to
					create and I would unknowingly spend a lot of time in a very irrelevant task. This is where the App
					helped!
					We looked for similar apps in the iOS and Android Market. There was nothing which was simple and
					straight forward.
				</p>
				<h3>USER RESEARCH </h3>
				<p>I discussed with few multi-taskers and could see that in the end they were practising mindfulness and
					doing one task at a time.
					In conclusion there were 2 different and distinct Personas and Onetask was something that everyone
					needed!

				<h3>THE FINAL APP</h3>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/OTUF.png" alt="" /></span>

				<li>I created the screens using Figma during the brainstorming and we just stuck to it! </li>
				<li>The prototype was developed using InVision. </li>
				<a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/BARFR5GCQJT#/screens" class="title" target="_blank">Click Here for the Prototype</a>
				<li>This simple App and Webpage was developed using only 4 screens. MINIMAL and SIMPLE</li>
				<br>
				<h3> THE APP SCREENS </h3>

				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/OTFinal.jpg" alt="" /></span>


				<br>
				<h3>LESSONS LEARNT</h3>
				<p><li> This journey taught me the essential aspects of designing in a small time frame, using existing
					tools.</li>
					<li>I was able to understand how to keep in mind, even if it is a simple app, the UX plays a major role.
