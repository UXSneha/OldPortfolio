				<p>An Organized App and Webpage having a variety Audio and Video content categorized for a flawless User
					Experience.
				</p>
				<h3>01 CONCEPT | BRAINSTORM | INFORMATION GATHERING
				</h3>
				<p>This approach and design concept is similar to a 2 Year project I worked with Accenture Knowledge
					Management team wherein we had to Organize the Knowledge and Training material whilst providing the
					best User Experience. <br> Since I had worked in a large team for a similar concept, listed out the
					stats for both the projects</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>

				<p> Initial Brainstorming consisted of :</p>
				<li>Categorization of the Data | Information Architecture of the data </li>
				<li>Making a list of tasks to accomplish along with timelines </li>
				<li>Create a series of questionnaire for User Interviews and Research </li>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/DS.png" alt="" /></span>
				<h3>02 USER RESEARCH AND PERSONA </h3>

				<li>I conducted interviews and surveys to identify the need for the app and the pain points, opportunity
					and insights </li>
				<li>I interviewed 4 people of age groups between 30-55 years, to understand their need for the app​
				</li>
				<br>
				<h4>DEMOGRAPHICS</h4>

				<p> --> 4 total participants<br>
					--> 2 female, 2 male <br>
					--> Ages range between 30-55 <br>
					--> All work in IT companies and want to spend quality time to unwind from their daily stress. <br>
					To align to the key functionalities with users needs, I set up my Persona. While developing the
					Persona, I kept in mind the major requirements and the key take away points of my User Research and
					it all summed up to the Persona below :</p>

				<h3>03 PROJECT LEARNING SO FAR
				</h3>
				<p>
					<li>Benefits of early user research
					<li>I cannot design a product users love without the help of the people who will actually use it!
					<li> This is important to understand the market and users, what do they need and how our product is
						going to help them!
					<li>Before any implementation, building lightweight wire-frames or clickable prototypes to walk your
						user through a given scenario really helps bring it to life.
					<li>Another important thing I have learned about this project was to communicate with developers as
						much as I can to create a better user experience
					</li>
				</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/DS2.png" alt="" /></span>

				<h3>04 EXPLORING DESIGN SOLUTIONS </h3>
				<p>Since this was an App that would be built from scratch, setting consistency with Colors and Fonts and
					creating a relevant Logo for this App was my starting point.
					<br>Created the design system library.​<br>
					<li>The Color Palette
					<li> Typography
					<li> Iconography
					<li> Sitemap
				</p>
				</li>
