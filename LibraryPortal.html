				<!--<h1 class="major">Redesigning a corporate Library Portal</h1>-->

				<p>Accenture library is a knowledge powerhouse for employees to improve their skillset, vocabulary,
					knowledge or even read to relax. Many useful resources are present in the library portal and the
					employees can access the online resources at any time as long as they are employed. Since many of
					the employees were unaware of the existence of the library within the company, we decided on
					spreading awareness and re-modelling the library portal, creating a mobile app for the frequently
					used URLs.

				<h3>01 CONCEPT | BRAINSTORM | INFORMATION GATHERING </h3>
				<!--<h4>MY ROLE</h4>
							<h4>TOOLS USED</h4>
							<h4>TEAM SIZE</h4>
							<h4>TIMELINE</h4>
							<h3>USER RESEARCH							</h3>-->
				<p>
					<li>Firstly we had to make the employees aware of the existence of the library
					</li>
					<li>Our users would be the internal employees of the company
					</li>
					<li>Since we had the mailing list handy â€“ newsletters would be a great way to spread awareness
					</li>
					<li>Posters within the company to see to that employees can access the information
					</li>
					<li>Organizing team events and contests in the library or through newsletters
					</li>
				</p>
				<h4>My role during this phase: (1st Sprint)</h4>
				<li>Designing the posters with the company's branding to be printed out and displayed in all accessible
					assembling areas of the employees like cafeteria etc.,
				</li>
				<li>Responsible to design the newsletter template and share across to the project manager who would be
					sending throughout the cities employee mailing list
				</li>
				<li>I also designed contest circulars for Library events
				</li>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Lib1.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>The posters were printed and displayed across the company. I prepared the newsletter template and it
					was shared across every Monday - called "Motivational Mondays"! There were several contests going
					through mail like crosswords etc., and the library portal was now under good usage. Here
					is when our second sprint started. The Library portal website started getting hits and the employees
					started visiting the library. </p>
				<h3>02 USER RESEARCH <br></h3>
				<h4><br>
					<li>

						STAKEHOLDER MEETING</li>
				</h4>

				<p>We met with the teams to which was responsible of the portal development the business requirement was
					"To Increase the employees' awareness of the existence of the library and utilization of the
					available facilities provided to the employees."
				</p>
				<h4>
					<li>
						USER INTERVIEWS</li>
				</h4>
				<p>First, we conducted the initial in-person interviews with the employees who came to visit the
					library. We chose 6 participants representing different requirement and career aspirations. </p>
				<h4>
					<li> PERSONAS </li>
				</h4>
				<p>I came up with three personas based on the user research.
					Mary, Peter and Joshua with different work experience, reading habits and need for the library.</p>

				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/LPPersona.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<h3>03 DESIGN OPTIONS </h3>
				<p>We started brainstorming different ideas and layouts. My main motive here was to do minimal changes
					to the existing portal design whilst making it easily accessible and user friendly. I began my
					design process with low fidelity sketches.
				</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Lib3.png" alt="" /></span>

				<h3>04 UI DESIGN
				</h3>
				<p>Since we were re-designing the existing portal, I decided to go with the current typography, color
					palette and branding logos with some additional complementary fonts and colors that would enhance
					the user interaction.
				</p>
				<p>After the sketches were ready, I met with the developers and discussed on the coding constraints and
					timelines. We decided to reuse of most of the existing components as it involved minimal changes to
					the existing code.
				</p>
				<p>After this phase, I started creating a prototype for testing. I used Invision Studio and Invision as
					it was easy to collaborate, being on the same page.
					Since the analytics found that the most clicked part of the website was borrowing, and most of our
					personas suggested this feature, I also created a mockup for a very basic App that would focus on
					borrowing and notification of due dates and availability of the resources.
				</p>

				<h3>05 USABILITY TESTING:
				</h3>
				<p>Before we went live with the changes, I've made a testing round in order to reveal possible usability
					problems. To better understand how users interact without newly changed portal, I conducted A/B
					Testing.
				</p>
				<li>We selected 12 employees to participate we asked them to select between the current and the modified
					portal
				</li>
				<li>The goal was to test the clarity of components and user experience

				</li>
				<li>We broke out our key performance indicators into tasks that could be clearly measured

				</li>
				<li>The employees gave great feedback including some prospects for improvement or upgrade of the current
					portal.
				</li>
				<p><br> <b><i> I also concluded how our personas would respond to the changes:</i>
						<br>Mary: </b>"I get notifications, and am able to track the resources I need!"
					<br><b>Peter:</b> "The search algorithm is better now and I know the site map and everything is
					accessible"
					<br><b>Joshua:</b> "I can publish my experience in the blog section and am able to guide interns
					outside my
					team as well" </p>

				<h3><br>06 PROJECT LEARNING:
				</h3>
				<li>This was an end to end project which I was involved and got an exposure to every aspect of the
					design journey

				</li>
				<li>I learnt how simple standard changes to a huge website would enhance the aesthetics and improve the
					user experience

				</li>
				<li>Interaction with users during user research and usability testing and the importance of user
					feedback and pain points

				</li>
				<li>Overall it was this project that refined my design capabilities and made me more empathetic

				</li>
